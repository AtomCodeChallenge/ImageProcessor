### Overview
It’s a fairly common thing for a website to require multiple copies of the same image, with different resolutions, compression ratios etc.

At Master of Malt, we go a stage further and allow third parties to request images from our image library, and we process the image to meet their requirements in terms of things like resolution.

This repository is the barebones of an API and service to process and return images. There are a variety of tasks that need to be completed to improve and fix the code.
